# These are not the tests you're looking for!

I know, I know. They *look* like tests. They're in a folder that says "tests". They have filenames that start with 'test_', and methods that will get picked up by nose if you're bold enough to try running it. Still, they aren't tests. At least, not functional ones. These "tests" are vestiges of an older codebase that vaguely resembled the present one. Did they ever work? Maybe. No one really knows. We'd like to think so. Why do we keep them around, if they no longer work? Maybe because we'd like to believe that, once upon a time, in a far away land, we were responsible enough to write tests for our software. It gives us hope that some day in the future, we might once again find the courage and moral resolve to do the right thing. But until that day cometh, you should probably move alongeth; there's nothing to see here.
